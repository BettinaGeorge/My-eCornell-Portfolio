    "In this section, I taught a neural network to predict if an Airbnb host is a superhost. I accomplished this using a dataset that contains 49 features, and I ran the algorithm for 100 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I did:\n",
    "- Learning rate: 0.1  \n",
    "- 3 Hidden layers (64, 32, 16 nodes)  \n",
    "- Sigmoid activation in the output layer  \n",
    "- Training time: ~90 seconds  \n",
    "- Classification threshold: 0.6  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "- Model training accuracy at the end: 93.17%  \n",
    "- Model validation accuracy at the end: 81.83%  \n",
    "- Model test accuracy: 81.39%  \n",
    "- Confusion matrix:  \n",
    "  This indicates that the model was quite effective at predicting the times when a host was not a superhost (4828 times), but it also failed to detect a lot of superhosts (852 predictions were wrong), and it did correctly classify superhosts 886 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I noted:\n",
    "- After about 30 - 40 epochs, validation loss began to increase, even though training accuracy continued to improve. This probably means the model was overfitting.\n",
    "- The model was better at predicting non-superhosts than at predicting superhosts.\n",
    "- I think that reducing the learning rate or introducing something like dropout could help reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I learned:\n",
    "I learned how to build and train a neural network using Keras. I also learned how to check performance using accuracy and the confusion matrix. I thought it was interesting that the model could be very accurate on training data and not always accurate on new data. I am still figuring things out, but I think this helped me understand how changing various elements (like the learning rate or number of layers) impacts how well the model performs.\n"
