Are the top two correlated features strongly or weakly correlated with the label? What about the remaining features? Are the two features strongly or weakly correlated with each other? Based on these answers, do these features seem appropriate to use for our machine learning problem?

For example, capital-gain is all over the place — most people have zero, and then a few jump to crazy high numbers. That kind of imbalance could throw off the model if we don’t scale it. Same goes for all the categorical data — the model can’t “read” strings, so we’ll need to convert them into numbers first.\n",
